# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision?
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

------
The story I am trying to tell with my website is twofold. The first story is basically going to be a resume. This is divided into four sections. The first section talks about me and what I like as well as what my plans are for college. The second section talks about what I have done in terms of work. From where I have worked to what volunteer work I have been a part of. The third section focuses on my final project (the fourth section is a link to the College of Wooster Library site, I am planning to change it in the future though).
The parts I found challenging with this project were the coding aspect. It was difficult for me to code but once I figured out where everything was it became easier. The picture of the turtle though, that I am still stuck on (IDK how I did that).
I challenged myself by getting help. You were the main reason as to why I was able understand how to get the website to work. I am going to continue to challenge myself by figuring out how to get music to play.
I take pride with the way the pictures are set up, as well as how they look on the website.

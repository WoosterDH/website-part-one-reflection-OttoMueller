# Website Reflection Prompt

Please write for me ~200 words reflecting on the following:
  * What is the story that you set out to tell with your website and how did you have to make decisions along the way to achieve that vision?
  * Where did you find challenges in this assignment?
  * How did you challenge yourself?
  * In what aspects do you take particular pride?

This will be considered as part of the evaluation for the first part of the Website project.

------
The story I am trying to tell with my website is twofold. The first story is basically going to be a resume. This is divided into four sections. The first section talks about me and what I like as well as what my plans are for college. The second section talks about what I have done in terms of work. From where I have worked to what volunteer work I have been a part of. The third section focuses on my final project (the fourth section is a link to the College of Wooster Library site, I am planning to change it in the future though).
The parts I found challenging with this project were the coding aspect. It was difficult for me to code but once I figured out where everything was it became easier. The picture of the turtle though, that I am still stuck on (IDK how I did that).
I challenged myself by getting help. You were the main reason as to why I was able understand how to get the website to work. I am going to continue to challenge myself by figuring out how to get music to play.
I take pride with the way the pictures are set up, as well as how they look on the website.

> You have clearly worked hard on this website project to-date. I know that you have pushed yourself to understand ideas that were heretofore foreign to you and to explore the workings of the site. You've done a good job so far. It's the "story" of the site that isn't so clear. In your first paragraph you say your "story" is twofold, but you only write about one of those folds: the resume. And the resume, as such, isn't so much a "story" as a list. As you work on this, think about what you want that work -- what you want that resume -- to say about you when someone lands on your site. We'll need to work on getting you a space to insert your portfolio work as well. You've done a fine job of detective work in getting the photos in there! Nicely done overall. Your facility and the site will grow with time; we can work on articulating the story. ~JAH
